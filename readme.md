# EASY ERP
Easy ERP has been developed for a friend which owns a repair shop. He wanted an ERP fitted for its needs and, at the same time, easy to use.

## Features
The ERP comes with different features:
- Product management
- Repair management
- Customers and affiliation program management

## Technologies
The whole project has been developed using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) as web framework
and [DjangoRestFramework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) has been used in order to build
reliable and flexible APIs; both of these frameworks are Python-based.

As persistent storage I have chosen the widely known and open source relational database
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) since it best suits our needs.

The web pages (i.e. the frontend as we love to call it) have been developed as a [separate project](https://github.com/Ph1l99/easyerpui).

## Usage
The project can be downloaded and executed as is, by configuring it on a host machine. <br>
Docker support will be added in the future.
